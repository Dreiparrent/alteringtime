                    The task you are being paid to complete is a letter-search task.

                <p>
                        Your job is to find the number of times the "search letter" appears in the box and then to enter that amount in the appropriate cell on a spreadsheet. For example, the answer to the box above is 7.
                </p>
                <p>
                        There are two yellow folders on your desk that contain pages of boxes. Each of these pages has six boxes. Once you find the answer to one of the boxes, enter that answer into the spreadsheet. To check whether the answer is correct hit "tab" or simply click on another cell. If your answer is correct, no message box will appear and youâ€™ll be able to continue entering answers into the spreadsheet. If the answer is incorrect, a message box will pop up indicating that you answered incorrectly. This message box will stay for five seconds.
                </p>
                <p>
                        To help you get used to this task, you will complete a two-minute practice period.
